                    <p> I like to challenge myself in order to learn something new. That is one of the main reasons why I decided to acquire 
                        knowledge about programming.
                        I spend most of my free time by climbing, what somehow led me to my current job as a receptionist 
                        at a climbing gym in my home city.</p>
